# kbd75 layout for ISO-SWE

> An ISO-style layout for Swedish keyboards.

This layout was specifically made for Swedish keyboards (i.e. includes `Å`, `Ö` and `Ä`), and is tested on a kbd75 purchased from [kbdfans](https://kbdfans.cn/) in March 2019.

### Specifics

As it's an ISO style keymap, it works with the fat double-row `Enter` key and the narrower left `Shift` and `<>` key. 

## Installation

Please see the [kbd75 readme](../../readme.md) using the following command

```
make kbdfans/kbd75/rev2:iso-sv
```
