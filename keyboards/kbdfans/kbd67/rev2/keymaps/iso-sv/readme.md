# ISO-SV keymap for KBD67 rev2

- An ISO-style layout for Swedish keyboards.

This layout was specifically made for Swedish keyboards (i.e. includes `Å`, `Ö` and `Ä`), and is tested on a KBD67 rev2 purchased from [kbdfans](https://kbdfans.com/) in December 2019.

### Specifics

As it's an ISO style keymap, it works with the fat double-row `Enter` key and the narrower left `Shift` and `<>` key. 

## Installation

Please see the [tada68 readme](../../readme.md) using the following command

```
make kbdfans/kbd67/rev2:iso-sv
```
